We can use some synthesizers and/or acoustic instruments within the ensemble. For example, half the ensemble members are playing pitches while the other half play samples, then they swap halfway through.

The specific octaves of the pitches are important, though performers can play with any dynamic level and rhythm, so long as there is a good balance between the samples and live performers.

Playing vs. not playing a sound means starting vs. stopping the looping of the individual sample slices.
